# mnisit-cuda-optimization
This repository provides a CUDA-accelerated neural network for MNIST classification, optimizing both forward and backward propagation. By parallelizing matrix multiplications, activations, and gradient calculations on the GPU, training and inference are significantly sped up, demonstrating improved performance over CPU-only models.
